Introduction Danny and Ruben

Danish Handclapping

We are passionate about making developing more fun and more productive.
We believe it's possible to strongly reduce tedious and repeatable code.
We have built a series of light-weight, well documented libraries for developing data-driven applications.

Find out type of audience. Game-developers / application developers / mobile developers
	Per group:
		Game developers pay attention to: mvc and signals
		Application developers: everything

Our libraries are designed to be:
	* cross platform (flash9 all, js some)
	* avoid library lockin
		functionality should be replacable by a different library
	* fast
		performed lot of benchmarking to find out the fastest procedures (depending on platform)

Business Applications:
	* lot of data
	* data is changing often
	* standard UI-components (form-elements, video, menus, buttons)

Game interface:
	* menus, screens, buttons
	* HUD: changing data



History
	* 2010 frustrated with re-inventing the wheel during development
	* used adobe flex quite long. Bloated framework.
	* decided to generalize parts of code and release it as a framework

Current status
	* 4 active developers (part-time)
	* 6 libraries released
	* help needed with cross-platform development




Libraries
	* Signals
		* light-weight event library (somewhat similar to as3-signals)

	* Bindable data
		* data-structures broadcasting events on changes (lists)
		* data-structures which can update on events

	* MVC
		* light-weight MVC framework
		* typed references to other MVC-actors
		* each MVC-actor can provide a manifest with MVC-actors it needs
			* MVC-actors can be reused in different projects

	* Display
		* extended functionality for Sprite/Shape/TextField/Bitmap
			* display-signals and mouse/keyboard signals
			* bindable child-list

	* Layout
		* basic layout-properties (size, position)
		* position child-layouts with algorithms
		* size can be specified in percentages
		* does not rely on any UI-specific properties
			-> can be used for svg, bitmaps, flash display-list, html-elements

	* Components
		* basic components: display + layout + graphics + behaviours + css-support
		* available components:
			* Button, ColorPicker, ComboBox, Panels, Form, List, TextArea, ProgressBar, Slider, ScrollBar, VideoPlayer, AudioPlayer
	
	* CSS
		* no more using platform specific apis
		* reuse style-definitions for multiple components
		* parser which compiles css to haxe-code
		* support for most css1, css2 and css3 properties
		* allows nested selectors
		* efficient algorithm to help components find all css that applies to the object
